# Certifies
# Project description
Certifies is automatic tool for measuring the risks of mixed source software which analyzes coupling intensity between host projects and third party libraries and shows the topological network graph to help developers understand complex structure of mixed source software.
# Background
In the process of software development, third-party libraries are widely used to reduce development time and costs. Mixed source software contains code from many different sources, which makes its system highly complex and diversified. However, there are various risks with the usage of third-party libraries, such as low quality standards or security vulnerabilities, which seriously affect the quality of mixed source software. Although tools such as Dependency Finder are able to analyze compiled Java code, there is no new measurement model that can accurately quantify the complexity and diversity of the host software system introduced by the dependency intensity of third-party libraries, aiming at the characteristics of mixed source software. It motivates us to develop Certifies, an automated tool to analyze the dependency intensity with third-party libraries.
